Howdy! I'm Marcus. I was a Marketing guy back in ancient times/undergrad and derailed to play pro sports.

Now, moving into my second career, I want to get into the FinTech space in the investment/wealth management sector.

I chose FinTech because the economy is changing in this direction, and I want to be ahead of the game.
